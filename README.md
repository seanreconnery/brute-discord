Discord has a "vulnerability" where files posted to private servers are publicly accessible with a simple link, even if you don't belong to the server (or even have Discord).

I got the idea for this a couple years ago after spending a little time on Discord.
I remembered from my "formative years" about the famous Kevin Mitnick hack where he spoofed SYN flags of a TCP handshake (iirc--it's been a long time).
Essentially, he "guessed" what the SYN would be to get an ACK back (and it worked)

This is in the same vein; if you can figure out the 18 digit numerical folder names, you can access the files that were shared.
